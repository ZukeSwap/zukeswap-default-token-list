## How to get your token LOGO on Zukeswap:

### 1. Image for the Token Logo <a id="1-image-for-the-token-logo"></a>

> * **File Extension**: `png` . Uppercase `PNG` is considered invalid
> * **File Name**ï¼š`logo.png`
> * **Size**: `256px by 256px`
> * **Background**: Transparent is a must

### 2. Token Information File <a id="2-token-information-file"></a>

> * Fork the repository and add the token information (example below) to zukeswap.tokenlist.json
> * Create a folder under assets/{tokenAddress}
> * Add the token icon (logo.png) under the folder created in the previous step
> * Add the token information in the zukeswap.tokenlist.json file, in the format shown below

The sample below shows what information has to be included on the `zukeswap.tokenlist.json` file.  
Please make sure that the details are accurate and follows the formatting.  
The contract address should follow the checksum address format \(see next requirement\).
